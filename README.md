<h2>Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning</h2>
<br>

<p>
<b>Project Overview:</b><br>
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to accurately predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, sulfates, and more. Using supervised machine learning algorithms, the model learns from a labeled dataset to classify wine into quality categories, helping winemakers and distributors assess quality without relying solely on human judgment.
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Objective:</b><br>
The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the quality score of a wine sample based on its chemical attributes. This not only automates the quality evaluation process but also increases reliability and consistency.
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Dataset:</b><br>
The dataset used is the publicly available <i>Wine Quality Dataset</i> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains red and white wine samples with features like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality (score between 0 and 10).

<br>

<p>
<b>Technologies Used:</b><br>
- Python<br>
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling<br>
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization<br>
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)<br>
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for development<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Approach:</b><br>
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing<br>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
3. Feature selection and normalization<br>
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets<br>
5. Applying multiple machine learning algorithms<br>
6. Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix<br>

<p>
<b>Results:</b><br>
The Random Forest Classifier gave the best results with an accuracy of around 85% on the test data. The model was able to effectively differentiate between low and high-quality wine samples based on their chemical properties.

<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
The Wine Quality Prediction system proves that machine learning can successfully classify wine quality with high accuracy. It can assist winemakers in quality control and improve the consistency of wine ratings by reducing reliance on subjective human assessments.
